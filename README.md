# Dplyr and Tidyr Lab Answers

Hello! This repository contains the solutions for the **Dplyr and Tidyr Lab** assignment given by Fabrice Rossi. Here's a brief overview of the content and the structure of this repository:

## 📂 Structure

- **R Project File**: This repository includes an R project file that encapsulates the entire project.
- **Data Files**: The datasets used for this assignment can be found in `.rds` format.
- **Quarto Document**: A detailed Quarto document is available with all the answers. Each exercise is separated using a second-level section, and individual questions within exercises have third-level sections.
- **HTML Rendering**: The Quarto document is also rendered to HTML for easy viewing.

## 🔍 Overview

The primary focus of this assignment was to practice and demonstrate proficiency in the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages of R. Throughout the exercises, various data manipulation and tidying tasks were performed to answer a series of questions.

## 📚 Dependencies

All file paths are constructed using the `here` package, ensuring that the Quarto document can be rendered without any modification upon unzipping. Please note that installing new packages directly in the code is strictly prohibited for this assignment.

## ✅ Grading

The quality of the code, as well as the choice of graphical representations, are taken into consideration during the grading process. Answers can be found in English.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the R project file to set the working directory.
3. Navigate to the Quarto document to view detailed answers for each exercise and question.
4. To view the HTML-rendered version of the answers, simply open the HTML file in your preferred browser.

## 🔄 Reproducibility

To ensure the reproducibility of results:

1. Ensure you have all the required packages installed, except the ones prohibited by the assignment guidelines.
2. Make sure the data files are in the correct directories as referenced in the code.
3. Run the code chunks in the Quarto document sequentially to avoid any dependency issues.

## 📣 Acknowledgment

A big thank you to Fabrice Rossi for providing this insightful lab assignment. It has been a great learning experience delving deep into `dplyr` and `tidyr` functionalities.
